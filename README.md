Question : in the ex3 ls2-edited.ipynb, I followed your instruction and made content/content/gdrive/mydrive/EastAsian/chinese..japanese..korean..uploadedcsvfiles

But, in the view data part, after running data=~~~~ part, there is only 1 class left('chinese') and 2 others gone. Also only in the chinese folder the data were saved. Can you tell me what was wrong?

Reply : You must run the folder + file and then download cells for each category

JW : Yes, I did for each category. But it didn't work, only being able to save chinese folder.
